🎬 Movie App — Powered by TMDB API
🧩 Description

This Movie App is a modern web application built with React and integrated with The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It allows users to explore a vast collection of movies, view trending titles, search for specific films, and check detailed information such as ratings, release dates, and overviews.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals and API integration. By building this app, I learned how to manage states efficiently, fetch data asynchronously, and create a clean, reusable component structure.
